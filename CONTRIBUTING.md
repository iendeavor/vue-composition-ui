## Reporting Issues

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed report when you encounter an issue.

Please make sure to include a reproduction repository or CodeSandBox so that bugs can be reproduced without great
efforts. The better a bug can be reproduced, the faster we can start fixing it!

## Pull Requests

We'd love to see your pull requests, even if it's just to fix a typo!

However, any significant improvement should be associated to an existing feature request or bug report.
